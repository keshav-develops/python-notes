# python-notes

A structured collection of Python lessons and exercises organized into **basic** and **advanced** levels.

This repository is ideal for:
- Self-learners who want a step-by-step guide  
- Students in classrooms or coding bootcamps  
- Instructors who want ready-to-use lessons and exercises  

Each topic is **self-contained** with example code, so you can run, modify, and experiment without worrying about dependencies.  
Exercises come with solutions, allowing you to check your understanding after trying them yourself.

## Learning Tips

1. **Start Small** – Focus on one lesson at a time.  
2. **Run & Modify Code** – Change values, loops, and functions to see what happens.  
3. **Attempt Exercises First** – Try solving problems before checking solutions.  
4. **Take Notes** – Writing down explanations helps reinforce concepts.  
5. **Revisit Topics** – Periodically go back to previous lessons; repetition strengthens understanding.  
6. **Experiment Beyond the Examples** – Try small variations, mini-projects, or integrate multiple lessons.  
7. **Use the Exercises Strategically** – Stretch challenges are meant to push your problem-solving skills.  

> Remember: Mastery comes from **active practice**, not just reading.
